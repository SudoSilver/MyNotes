Copying a directory or file to another location is very simple just:
```bash
cp ~/Downloads/file.txt ~/Desktop
```
simply put the path where the file is then the path where you want the copy to be.

To copy an entire directory though we have to use the -r flag which stands for recursive:
```bash
cp -r ~/Downloads/directory ~/Desktop
```
