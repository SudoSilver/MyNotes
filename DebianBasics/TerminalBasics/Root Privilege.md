This is a specific user that you can set on your system that has the most privileges and can do everything without needing [[Sudo]]. If the user you are logged in as has *Root Privilege* you don't need [[Sudo]] and using it could error out.

It is not recommended that you use a root user on your system as it is more privileged it means it makes your system unnecessarily vulnerable. A virus on a root user is much more likely to harm your system.  Even if Linux is much less likely to have a virus ***EVERY MISTAKE AS ROOT IS DANGEROUS*** 

To prove just how dangerous a mistake with root privilege is:
1. A typo
2. Removing the wrong file
3. Editing a configuration file carelessly 
which are all mistakes that could happen can make a system not work anymore.
