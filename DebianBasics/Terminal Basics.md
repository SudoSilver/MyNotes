This is a list of commands that I use every day on Linux specifically Debian and I consider fundamental to my workflow.

1. [[Change Directory]]
2. [[List Directories]]
3. [[Apt Basics]]
4. [[Removing Files and Directories]]
5. [[Sudo]] and [[Root Privilege]] 
6. [[Helpful tools]] 

I am trying to explain this simply and in a friendly tone as I know Linux feels complicated at the start. Many will tell you to just "Read the manual" or even worse "RTFM" which are uninviting and don't actually help as Linux should be more accessible and I try to achieve that by giving a starter guide of sorts.
