These are the notes i have made in my attempt of understanding as much as possible about programming and computers in general up to now i have covered:
1. What the computer offers in terms of processing and memory
2. Volatile memory
3. The Stack
4. The Heap
5. The Static part of the memory
6. Pointers
7. What is a Segfault 

I took this notes as they are going to be of massive help as i am developing my own Operating System alongside some friends (here is a link: https://github.com/MOS-Official/MOSOfficial) and many more projects to come. 

I hope to see comments from others and hear opinions tips and even have your notes to expand on my knowledge on how programming and computers work.
