These are the notes i have made in my attempt of understanding as much as possible about programming and computers in general up to now i have covered:
1. [[What a computer gives Je| What the computer offers in terms of processing and memory]]
2. [[Volatile| Volatile memory]]
3. [[Stack| The Stack]]
4. [[Heap| The Heap]]
5. [[Static| The Static part of the memory]]
6. [[Pointer| Pointers]]
7. [[Segfault| What is a Segfault]] 

I took this notes as they are going to be of massive help as i am developing my own Operating System alongside some friends (here is a link: https://github.com/MOS-Official/MOSOfficial) and many more projects to come. 

I hope to see comments from others and hear opinions tips and even have your notes to expand on my knowledge on how programming and computers work.
